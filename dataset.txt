Uid, playlist_id, track_id are all unique for each user, playlist and track in Spotity. 

Because we may focus on the human creators(experts), I ignored playlists created by “Spotify”. For some users, there exists other users who follows their playlists, we defined them as the creators. So now we have users and creators. To filter out some inactive users, I removed users who follow less than two other users and creators(users) who are followed by less than two users. This dataset contains following-relationship between 4196 users and 3309 creators. 

There are three files:
1. output_user_follow_pl_partial.csv - there are three columns (uid, creator, playlist). Each row represents that the user follow a playlist created by another user. 
2. creator_pl_partial.json - stores all the playlists created by each creators. The data structure will be like
{CREATOR_ID:{PLAYLIST_ID:[LIST OF TRACKS IN THIS PLAYLIST]}}
3. track_features_info_partial.txt - Audio Features for Tracks appear in the previous file. I try my best to fetch for each track that appears in the previous file, but maybe there is still some missing. Those features are from Spotify API( https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-several-audio-features/ ). Each line contains the information following:
id, danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode speechless, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, duration_ms, time_signature
